Game is mostly modular right now.

Instructions (run in interpreter):
1. import objects and blackjack as well as all classes from these two files
2. instantiate Blackjack, provide 2 arguments as player 1 and player 2 names if needed
3. call Blackjack_instance.play() and enjoy!

Notes: lots of bug testing comments still in code that need to be cleaned up, final update coming soon
